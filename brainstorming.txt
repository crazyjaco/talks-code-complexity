WordCamp 2016 Talk brainstorming

code complexity


Common software measurements include:

Number of classes and interfaces
Number of lines of code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code)
Number of lines of customer requirements
Program execution time
Program load time
Program size (binary)
Cohesion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science))
Coupling (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming))

Balanced scorecard
Bugs per line of code
Code coverage

Comment density[1]
Connascent software components

Cyclomatic complexity (McCabe's complexity)
DSQI (design structure quality index)
Function Points and Automated Function Points, an Object Management Group standard[2]
Halstead Complexity
Instruction path length
Maintainability index

Robert Cecil Martin's software package metrics
Weighted Micro Function Points
CISQ automated quality characteristics measures

Bio 

Bradley is a Sr. Full Stack Developer at The Boston Globe. Knowledge sharing and career development are major priorities for him. He is a regular attendee at local meetups and enjoys the opportunity when he can give back. When Bradley is not breaking his development environment playing with new software, he can generally be found reading, finding new things to learn, or discussing the finer points of Transformers continuity.

Measuring Code Quality

Code quality is an abstract and often subjective topic.
How is it possible to define and measure such a concept as the quality of our code?
Are there existing tools we can leverage to help us gain insight?
In this talk, we will dig into different concepts such as NPATH, Cyclomatic Complexity and Fanout.
We'll take a look at some static analysis tools, learn how to interpret their feedback, and integrate them into our own workflow.
Finally we will apply what we have learned against the WordPress codebase and see how it stacks up.
This talk is for all levels of developers.
